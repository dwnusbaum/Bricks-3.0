# Project Concept

Bricks 2.0 is a web application that is used in COMP 110 to teach students how to program.  The professor assigns coding problems to students, who use Bricks to write their solution to each problem and submit it. Bricks automatically grades each problem for correctness and style.  Students can submit questions for problems and receive answers to their questions, and the professor is easily able to see the status and progress of all of the students in the class.

We've been tasked with building the next version of the platform - Bricks 3.0. This new version will include the following new features and/or enhancements:

* Pair programming functionality allowing two or more students to work on a programming assignment at the same time
* Design and layout updates

All in all, our goal is to make it easier for the professor to teach the class using Bricks, while simultaneously adding additional features and making the application simple for the students, so they can learn how to program quickly and more effectively.
