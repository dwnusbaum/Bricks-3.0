1. As a student, I want to work with my teammate on a pair programming assignment.  I want to be able to see what the other student is typing and be able make suggestions and improvements of my own.  I also want to be able to submit our assignment together.

2. As a professor, I want to be able to assign problems to the students which they are able to complete in pairs.  When they turn in the assignment, I want it to be graded once, and I want to be able to see exactly who worked together on each problem.
